## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

### What I learned

My first projects that includes JS. So I had tons of trouble with it, however... thanks to Brad Traversy I managed to complete it.

### Continued development

Added some extra JS that outlines with green color the input when you did it correctly.
